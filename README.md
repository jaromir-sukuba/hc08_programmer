# Programmer for HC08 devices

This project is leftover from my love affair Motorola/Freescale/NXP HC08 MCUs. It was my third MCU type I actually used - PIC16 something was first, then MCS51 and then HC08. I really like them, but few years from entering the market with big fanfare, marketing at Freescale decided to toss the HC08 into bin, remove it from development software and trying to convince the users about how much compatible are the incompatible HCS08. Now the HC08 are almost extinct and you can buy lust last supplies of them, for horrible prices. This was my last encounter with MCU from Freescale and I swore I'll never use anything from them. Now they are bought by NXP and I'm not sure what to do now :-)
No matter what, the HC08 keep stable place in my heart. I still have a few of them in my home stock and this programmer is my tribute to this nice little family of MCUs I'll never forget.

# Current status
it is very unfinished. Supports only MC68HC908KX2 out of the box, it is slow as hell, the HC08 chips are hard to find. This project is useless. 
Please wait while I upgrade it to get more universal and polished, then it will be useless as well, though.
